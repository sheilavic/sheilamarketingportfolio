                <p>Hi! My name is Sheila! I recently graduated from the University of Southern California (USC), with a bachelors degree in Business Administration and a minor in Consumer Behavior.</p>
                <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how people think, whether it’s through stories in books and movies or the choices they make every day. That curiosity naturally led me to marketing, where I get to combine creativity and strategy to make ideas meaningful and impactful.</p>
                <p>With experience across product management, financial analysis, branding, and consulting, I love turning insights into thoughtful strategies that connect with people and drive growth. I’m especially passionate about understanding what moves consumers and using data to tell stories that inspire action.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, you can usually find me playing board games, doing Pilates, or baking something sweet to share with friends. Something you may not know about me is that I grew up living in four different countries! I have lived in Laos, Thailand, Ethiopia and Italy.</p>
